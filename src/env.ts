/**
 * Where this project keeps a secret, and where it does not (SPEC.md §85).
 *
 * `.env` is the answer to both. It is gitignored, it is the file `.env.example`
 * documents, and `src/app.ts` reads it back on the next boot — so a credential
 * written here survives a restart without ever being typed twice.
 *
 * The place a credential must *not* go is a stream. `assemora start` inherits the
 * stdout and stderr of whatever supervises it, so a password or an API token printed
 * on boot is a password or an API token in the log aggregator, in the terminal
 * scrollback and in whatever CI keeps. `docs/rules/security.md` is unambiguous about
 * that, and a file people read to learn the shape is the worst possible
 * place to set the other example.
